# COVID-19 Global Impact Dashboard

An interactive R Shiny web application analyzing pandemic outcomes across 200+ countries, examining relationships between population size, testing intensity, and mortality metrics.

**Course**: MTH208 - Data Science Lab 1 | **Institution**: IIT Kanpur | **Duration**: July - November 2025

##  Project Overview

This Shiny dashboard explores critical questions about the COVID-19 pandemic:
- How does testing intensity affect case detection rates?
- Does population size correlate with per-capita mortality?
- What patterns emerge when comparing countries regionally?
- Which countries are statistical outliers in their pandemic response?

The application combines real-time data exploration with statistical rigor, demonstrating advanced data science techniques in a production-ready interactive format.
